**toolbox** is a curated collection of utility libraries for Python and Rust, designed to support common development tasks across multiple projects.
It provides reusable components for logging, concurrency, decorators, path management, error handling, text parsing, and other general-purpose utilities.

This repository is intended as a personal utility suite rather than a single-purpose library.
